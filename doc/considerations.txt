1) make the file? 
txt file kind of like a test

2) develop the classes?


sequence 
1) read input files (txt)
2) distribute to players (4 cards each)
3) distribute to decks (all of the remaining equally)
4) store the cards in players(hands) and decks 
5) initialise game play ( all players will do the next bit simultaneously) ( print functionality)
    1) pick a card from their left
    2) process the card ( comapre it with the cards at hand / preferred card thingy)
    3) discard a card to the right
6) keep taking rounds (checking if the 4 cards are of the same number / if won )
7) over whenn one or more players have 4 of the same cards

/// can win even if the four cards are not the preferred cards.
/// hve to check if the players won at the start of the game.
/// need a step to assign preferred cards?
/// fifo (pick up card from top, discard to bottom)
//// have to print all functions


// how to assign players left and right 
 player id + 1 

 put an execption when assigning left and right
 if player = number of players, start from the beginning

when making this exception, should we make it in the main class?

should we include      
* @throws PlayerWonException ???? if the deck has 4 cards of same value at the beginnning??? 
or have a method check this in main 


alssoooo
is carddeck supposed to be deck?
