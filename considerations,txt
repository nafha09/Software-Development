1) make the file? 
txt file kind of like a test

2) develop the classes?


sequence 
1) read input files (txt)
2) distribute to players (4 cards each)
3) distribute to decks (all of the remaining equally)
4) store the cards in players(hands) and decks 
5) initialise game play ( all players will do the next bit simultaneously)
    1) pick a card from their left? right?
    2) process the card ( comapre it with the cards at hand / preferred card thingy)
    3) discard a card to the right? left?
6) keep taking rounds
7) over whenn one or more players have 4 of the same cards

/// can win even if the four cards are not the preferred cards.
/// hve to check if the players won at the start of the game.
/// need a step to assign preferred cards?
